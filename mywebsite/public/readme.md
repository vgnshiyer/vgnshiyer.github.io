I am a Software Engineer from India interested in developing technologies that contribute to our development.
<br>
<br>
With over 3 years of experience as a Backend developer and a DevOps engineer, I have made significant contributions in my previous organizations, which help generate millions in annual revenue.
Having a motivation and a drive to learn new things, I keep exploring new technologies, building projects and regularly contributing open source.

<br>
At my work place, I try to look for repetitive processes and come up with solutions to improve performance by automation. Streamlining workflows resulted in increased efficiency, less errors and more free time for my colleagues to focus on more complex and strategic tasks. This includes leveraging a Kubernetes operator to handle automating infrastructure provisioning for a Kafka cluster, writing AWS Lambda functions to automate file checking in S3 buckets, and building cron jobs for sending out regular metric data via emails.
<br>
<br>
As a developer, I take proactive approach in leveraging my problem solving skills to find solutions to complex problems. Using my programming skills, I focus on writing clean and maintainable code in languages Java, Python, C++, Go ensuring that my work adheres to the industry best practices and coding standards. This includes developing a custom migration tool for streaming millions of records from on-premise to cloud for my previous company.
<br>
<br>
During my free time, I love exercising, learning about nutrition, playing music (Guitar, keyboard), reading biographies.
