### Background

Yesterday at midnight, I decided to  work on a long stagnant project of mine. The ASU Sparky Sundevil Resume template - A LaTex template that I had written last year. Amidst all the dreadful assignments and tiring job hunt, this project was left unmaintained and had gathered dust. I realized that it had become a valuable resource for ASU students as many people reached out to me telling me how helpful they found it. Yet, there have also been many issues pointed out to me via email/whatsapp. I found that this was a good time to address those issues.

So, after hours of dedicated work I present to you release v0.2.1 of the ASU Resume Template which has a well documented support for different sections, various bug fixes, optimizations and workarounds to known issues. And this time, I promise to keep the project maintained with regular patches and fixes to any issues that you may encounter. 

### Objectives

For this release, I focussed my attention on 3 main things.

1. Using semantically meaningful commands.
2. Keeping the `.tex` file bereft of any formatting clutter, allowing you to focus solely on your content.
3. Comprehensive documentation for using each section. 

Moving forward, my goal is to maintain the extensibility of pointers 1 and 2 with minimal alterations, while frequently updating pointer 3.
