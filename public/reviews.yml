      title: "The 5AM Club"
      author: "Robin Sharma"
      review: "Was life changing for me. I found going to bed early more challenging. Although, I don't find it practical to wake up at 5 everyday. Been waking up comfortably at 6:30 without having to force myself out of bed."

      title: "The 4 Hour Work Week"
      author: "Tim Ferriss"
      review: "I like the New Rich concept. Plus the cool techniques of avoiding distracting things/people. Also, the idea of outsourcing and automating tasks was interesting. I probably took working remotely to the extreme, so much that my manager thinks I was slacking off. And no, I don't work from a hammock in Bali or something. "

      title: "The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement"
      author: "Eliyahu M. Goldratt"
      review: "A cool peak into business operations management. The story was too engaging that I kept coming back to it. Although I stopped reading after the protagonist got promoted as the division manager. The bottleneck concept was interesting. I have been killing Herbie's in my life ever since."

      title: "Elon Musk"
      author: "Walter Isaacson"
      review: "Another Walter Isaacson masterpiece. Inspiring read. Although I feel like there could be more volumes to this book about this person. The man has no intention of slowing down."
